#Invaders-Must-Die

Invaders Must Die!: Another Space-Invaders-like game that you will love.

#**DISCLAIMER**: Game **unfinished**.

## What and why I do this?
Well, this started as a tutorial I was following, then I liked and decided to add new features (new attacks, new combos) and I realized it was fun.

This is my first game. My plan is to achieve something fun and playable. AND MIT LICENSED!

## Current features
Now it's full randomized, but its difficulty will be increasing by number of enemies killed on future versions.
### Invaders
 * They spawn randomly in position and speed.
 * Its fire rate is also random.
 * They shoot small balls that collide with you and your bullets.

### You
You have 4 types of shooting:
* One-bullet shot.
* Three-bullet shot.
* Ten-bullet shoot.
* Awesome **15-bullet shoot**.

You have currently 3 lifes, one *per* shot.
